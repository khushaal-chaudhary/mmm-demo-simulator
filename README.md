## üöÄ Features

* **Dual Modes:**
    * **Sandbox Mode:** A consequence-free playground to explore how changing budgets and channel allocations affect predicted sales.
    * **Challenge Mode:** Receive a unique business scenario, budget, and sales goal from the AI Analyst.
* **Intelligent AI Opponent:** Powered by the Gemini API, the analyst generates creative challenges and provides data-driven feedback on your strategy, understanding the nuances of the underlying model.
* **Advanced MMM Engine:** The simulation isn't just linear. It's powered by a sophisticated model that accounts for:
    * **Adstock (Decay):** The lingering effect of advertising over time.
    * **Saturation (Diminishing Returns):** The more you spend on a channel, the less effective each additional dollar becomes.
* **Switchable Market Scenarios:** Choose between different market types (e.g., "Fast-Moving Goods" vs. "High-Consideration Goods") which loads a different underlying model with unique adstock and saturation parameters, reflecting real-world market dynamics.
* **Dynamic UI:** The interface is built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring animated Lottie files for the AI analyst's persona.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python with Flask
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
